# About Storybook

Storybook is a mobile app that allows users to write a collection of stories about their lives â€” throughout their lives.

## Design Process

Have you ever had a "I want to remember this moment forever" moment? If so, then Storybook is perfect for you. If not, are you even living?

And thus, Storybook was created.

Here are some User Stories:
- As a teen, I want to write stories about my wild moments, so that I can tell them to my future grandkids.
- As an aspiring writer, I want to write down important moments in my life, so that I will have material for my biography if I ever become famous.
- As an aging old man, I want to leave stories behind, so that future generations will know about our time.
